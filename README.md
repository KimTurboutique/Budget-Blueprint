# Budget Blueprint

## Description


## User Story
As a user, I want a financial analysis app to compare the cost of living between two cities based on my income and expenses. I expect to input my income, select cities, and receive a breakdown of expenses (food/transportation/housing). The app should analyze whether my income covers the expenses and provide clear results to help me make informed decisions about relocation or travel. I also want the app to store this data analysis in my profile for future reference.`
